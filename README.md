# Basic HTML Website

Welcome to the second project of the [Roadmap.sh Fronted Projects, the Basic HTML Website Project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-html-website). This project is fairly simple, but I have created a tutorial video and blog post none the less.

I like to plan my projects out in the repository README.md, so we'll go ahead and do just that.

## What Skills We'll Use from the Frontend Roadmap

- Learn how to create multiple pages in a website.
- Structure a website using HTML in a semantic way.
- Structure in a way that you can easily add styles later.
- Add SEO meta tags to the website.

## Pages to Create

- Homepage
- Projects Page
- Articles Page
- Contact Page with a Contact Form

## To Do List

- Create `index.html` and setup Home page
- Create `projects.html` and set link to page in Navbar
- Create `/projects/project-one.html` etc. for every project
- Create `articles.html` and set link to page in Navbar
- Create `/articles/article-one.html` etc. for every article
- Create `contact.html` and add contact form
- Add Key SEO Meta Data in the `<head></head>` elements
- Make it so styles are easy to add later on (and maybe use some styling if necessary)
- Render Navbar on every page
