# Basic HTML Website

Welcome to the second project of the [Roadmap.sh Fronted Projects, the Basic HTML Website Project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-html-website). This project is fairly simple, but I have created a tutorial video and blog post none the less.

I like to plan my projects out in the repository README.md, so we'll go ahead and do just that.

## What Skills We'll Use from the Frontend Roadmap

- Learn how to create multiple pages in a website.
- Structure a website using HTML in a semantic way.
- Structure in a way that you can easily add styles later.
- Add SEO meta tags to the website.
